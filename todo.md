## Simd opreations
    
- [ ] Add simd multiplications to vector (check zmath for it)
- [ ] Add simd addition to vector (check zmath for it)
- [ ] Change the detect collision to loop for all particles in a grid cell and the pass all values to check_collions
- [ ] Accept list of particles as args and use simd to check for collisions
- [ ] Accept simd vectors for collision Resolution
